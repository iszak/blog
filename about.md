I'm a Web Developer based in London, working for [Secret Sales][1]
specialising in front-end and back-end development using
HTML, CSS, JS for the front-end and PHP, Symfony, ZF for the back-end.

I also attempt to be a regular IRC user and always reside in the
[Freenode][2] network under the username "iszak" where I find myself
helping people but also asking for help myself.
