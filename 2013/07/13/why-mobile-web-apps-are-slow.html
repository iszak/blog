<p>Definitely recommend reading this article (<strong>hint</strong>: it’s long, but worth it),
it talks more from the perspective of intense mobile web apps (image/video
processing, games). No, not those apps that are essentially a website in a
<a href="http://phonegap.com/">PhoneGap</a>/<a href="http://cordova.apache.org/">Cordova</a> wrapper sprinkled with some of their APIs.</p>

<p>That said, I won’t stop using JavaScript to build mobile web applications, but I
am now even more conscious of memory and CPU usage and limits.</p>
