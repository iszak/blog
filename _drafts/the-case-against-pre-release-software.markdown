Lately I've seen a lot of published articles by prominent members of the web
community, those who I would call "web celebrities" that have been promoting the
use of pre-release software, by pre-release software I refer to anything that is
prior to 1.0. Such libraries include Ember.js which I'm personally excited about
however I won't use until it's 1.0 because by using pre-release software there's
a chance that it will change significant and I'll have to re-write a lot of code.
