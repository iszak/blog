I'm a Senior Web Developer based in London, United Kingdom working for
[Karmarama][1] specialising in front-end and back-end development using
HTML, CSS, JS for the front-end and PHP, ZF for the back-end.

I also attempt to be a regular IRC user and always reside in the
[Freenode][2] network under the username "iszak" where I find myself
helping people but also asking for help myself.
