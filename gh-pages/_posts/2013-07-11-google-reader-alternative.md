Anyone who is still looking for a Google Reader alternative I recommend
[Feedly][1]. The reason behind this is it seems to have the most cross-platform
implementations and a good community behind it. That's not to say something like
[The Old Reader][2] isn't any good but it's lack of cross platform
implementations bothered me. That has now changed with a few third parties using
their API.

The only gripe I have with Feedly is that images can sometimes load slow,
perhaps it's my connection. But I would gladly pay $5 USD / month to receive
a better service which I'm waiting to be offered.

Speaking of feeds, [I also have a feed][3]
