I've finally found some time to rebuild my blog as I'm on holiday, it's been
through many phases, once static HTML, then WordPress, then Tumblr and finally
back to static HTML, kind of. I'm using [Jekyll][1] which compiles to static HTML
definitely recommend checking it out if you want a platform that gets out of
your way.

As for the design, this is actually one I used circa 2010 but it has been
rebuilt to use modern web practices such as mobile first, responsive web design
with sprinklings of CSS3. That said, I haven't actively tested it on legacy
browsers and probably won't. This design is still a work in progress.
