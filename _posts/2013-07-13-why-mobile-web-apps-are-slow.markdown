Definitely recommend reading this article (**hint**: it's long, but worth it),
it talks more from the perspective of intense mobile web apps (image/video
processing, games) no not those apps that are essentially a website in a
[PhoneGap][1]/[Cordova][2] wrapper sprinkled with some of their APIs.

That said, I won't stop using JavaScript to build mobile web applications, but I
am now even more conscious of memory and CPU usage.
