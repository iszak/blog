I've been spending a lot of time recently getting my development environment setup, I've found once I've learnt a better way to do things, I won't want to go back to the old way. So when I learnt about Puppet, I didn't want to go back to a shell script or manual installation. But these tools take a lot of investment to setup and get right, then you may find out about a complementing technology such as hiera or facter, which you then have to go back to the drawing board and re-iterate.

Finally I am satisfied with my development environment such that it's easy to work on all the different technologies my projects use from static, node, ruby and php projects so I thought I'd share it on my blog.

My [development environment][1]; built with Vagrant, Packer, Puppet, Hiera.
